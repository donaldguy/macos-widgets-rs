## `widgets`

### üîç meta-prelude: the "mystery" of the binary members  üîé

<details>
  <summary><h5>TL;DR / Spoilers:</h5></summary>
<pre>They are raw nested binary plists.</pre>
</details>
<details open>
  <summary><h5>full story</h5></summary>
Looking at those binary blobs, I initially anticipated more involved reverse
engineering

but (the eagle-eyed among you might notice a suspicious repeat everywhere of
prefix, & if you take the next step,)

```shell
plutil -extract widgets.DesktopWidgetPlacementStorage raw !$ \
| base64 -D | hexdump -C -n 8
```
```output
00000000  62 70 6c 69 73 74 30 30           |bplist00|
00000008
```

‚Ä¶ as [magic numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_number_(programming)) go, pretty self-explanitory. But to ask the experts to verify

```shell
^hexdump -C -n 8^(echo; file -)^
```
```output
plutil -extract widgets.DesktopWidgetPlacementStorage raw com.apple.notificationcenterui.plist | base64 -D | (echo; file -)

/dev/stdin: Apple binary property list
```
</details>

Indeed it is just[^1] another binary plist file!


[^1]: I spent probably altogether too long thinking these were in fact "base64 encoded nested binary plists", but in fact despite what I think the word `raw` means, Apple doesn't wanna mess up your terminal and so
```shell
man plutil | \
grep -B1 -A3 'the value printed depends'; (printf "%13s\n" "‚Ä¶"; !!0-1 | grep 'data')
```
```output
RAW VALUES AND EXPECTED TYPES
     With -extract keypath raw the value printed depends on its type.

     Following are the possible expect_type values and how they will be
     printed when encountered with -extract keypath raw
            ‚Ä¶
            data         a base64-encoded string representation of the data
```


### `widgets`.`vers`
a version number, I presume. `1`, classic.

### `widgets`.`DesktopWidgetPlacementStorage` <small>(v1)</small>

This is probably what is gonna be most interesting to this project:


`{`

`CompatibilityVersion = 1 ,`

`NumberedDisplays` &rarr; `[{`

- `Number`: zero indexed (ordered how?)

- `Resolutions[0]`[^2]  `={`

    -  `Groups`: 1 or more collections of widgets on e.g. left and right of screen &rarr; `[`

        - `Items`: the individual widgets &rarr; `[{`
            - `Column`: from 0 to \[max determined by number & size of widgets\] (+1 small, +2 medium & large, +4 XL)
            - `Identifier`: a UUID
            - `Row`: from 0 to \[max determined by number & size of widgets\] (+1 small & medium, + 2 large & XL),
            - `Size`: `{( "Small"| "Medium" | "Large" | "ExtraLarge") => {} }` - one imagines this is a memberless enum serialization?
            - `ZOrder` -  0‚Ä¶{number of items}. Presumably this is the z-index, but whereas the layout engine doesn't let you layer via
            click and drag, in practice its a most-recently-dragged (highest most recent) `}, {‚Ä¶}, ‚Ä¶]`
        - `Origin = [ $offset_from_left, $offset_from_top ]`. In (HiDPI) pixels `}`

    - `Size = [$width, $height]`, In (HiDPI) pixels. `},`

    - `{ ‚Ä¶ that for other display(s) /w widgets? ‚Ä¶ },`

  `  ]`
`}`


[^2]: the support was/is there at some point, but Apple is holding out on us! If this was utilized I probably wouldn't have gotten into any of this, as all I
really wanted is to be able to have more widgets on my ultrawide monitor than my 13" macbook air screen!

<details>
<summary><h5>command line exploration continued</h5></summary>


To get at this nested ones I'll use this:
```shell
nplutil() {
  local k; k=$1; shift;
  plutil -extract widgets.$k raw com.apple.notificationcenterui.plist \
  | base64 -D \
  | plutil "$@" -
}
```

This is all prety fixed length, so 20 lines should bring you to end of your first widget

```shell
nplutil DesktopWidgetPlacementStorage -p | head -20
```
```output
{
  "CompatibilityVersion" => 1
  "NumberedDisplays" => [
    0 => {
      "Number" => 0
      "Resolutions" => [
        0 => {
          "Groups" => [
            0 => {
              "Items" => [
                0 => {
                  "Column" => 0
                  "Identifier" => "438AD4D3-278A-4506-8417-6FF8980004AE"
                  "Row" => 0
                  "Size" => {
                    "Medium" => {
                    }
                  }
                  "ZOrder" => 4
                }
```

I have 9 widgets (despite 10 members of `widgets`.`instances` ‚Ä¶ TBD why ) and its 9 lines of head-matter then ~9 lines per widget so to pick up the remaining members of `Groups[0]` and `Resoulutions[0]`

```shell
nplutil DesktopWidgetPlacementStorage -p | tail -n +$((9 + 9*9))
```

```output
                }
              ]
              "Origin" => [
                0 => 2286
                1 => 6
              ]
            }
          ]
          "Size" => [
            0 => 3008
            1 => 822
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### `widgets`.`instances`

this is where state lives for the widgets you are actually actively using (have instantiated). Once you extract and parse them they are actually just:

`[{`

- `uuid` : in fact a UUID. \[mostly\] matching the `Identifier` of the corresponding `Item` in `plist(widgets.DesktopWidgetPlacementStorage).NumberedDisplays.*.Resolutions.0.Groups.*.Items.*.Identifier`

  [with additional entries not matching those for widgets, if any, configured to show on notification center view]

- `widget` :  Surprise! üéä its actually another layer of nested raw binary plist.


`},]`

>a silly Aside:
> its interesting to me that top-level of the plist there is one camelCase attribute, one-kebab case attribute, and then one single-word one; then a layer down theres `PascalCase` key with a `PascalCase` set off values, and here its back to lowercase)

### `widgets`.`instances[*]`.`widget`

 In particular, once decoded, this inner `widget` plist is a bundles of objects output by [`NSKeyedArchiver`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nskeyedarchiver) ;

 layed out like:

- `$version` = all the ones I looked at it is `100000` (less classic)
- `$top = {`
  - `$root`: a `CFKeyedArchiverUID` object, with value = 1 `}`
    - that value and other UID objects with such seem to point into the index of `$objects`
- `$objects = [ <the serialized objects of the graph> ]`


There is some variance amongst my 10, but walking that graph through `$objects` by UID value, each appears to be an object of class `CHSWidget`
> apparently, going by `.tbd`s, a native of `ChronoServices.framework`
> -in `$objects` slot `1` (hereafter `$1`, after `$null` in `$0`)

with attributes:

- `activityIdentifier` : `$null` (for all mine)
- `family` = `1` |`2` | `3`  enum corresponding more-or-less to [`WidgetFamily`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/widgetkit/widgetfamily):
    - `1` = small
    - `2` = medium
    - `3` = both large
    - `4` = extra large
- `kind`: a string  naming the widget per app devs
    (e.g. `EventListWidget`)
    (ending up in 6th slot or bumped down to 7 by the device Id)
- `extensionIdentity` [&rarr;`$2`  ] an object of class `CHSExtensionIdentity`
    with attributes:
  - `deviceIdentifier` =
    - when mac local: [`$0 =`] `$null`,
    -  when procied from iphone: [`$5`:] a class 7 UUID (presumably referring to my iPhone)
  - `containerBundleIdentifier` [&rarr;`$4`] =  e.g. `"com.flexibits.fantastical2.mac"`
  - `extensionBundleIdentifier` [&rarr; `$3` ] = e.g.` "com.flexibits.fantastical2.mac.FantasticalWidgets"`
- `intent2` ; app specific data?,
  - sometimes `$null`,
  - sometimes (apparently for both families) an an object of class (`CHSIntentReference` with a `stableHash` value and `idata` pointing at an object of class [`NSMutableData`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsmutabledata/)
    > For the one I looked at the `NS.data` is _not_ a plist; does contian numerous meaningful-ish utf8 strings
    > I'm guessing this rev-eng is done and/or apple discloses more about the format BUT I doubt I have any need to go this deep


[^3]: not apparently

`nplutil` takes us a little further

```shell
nplutil instances.0 -p
```
```output
{
  "uuid" => "6003AFEE-C0E5-4204-BEAA-08ABB4D7F71D"
  "widget" => {length = 4024, bytes = 0x62706c69 73743030 d4010203 04050607 ... 00000000 00000f18 }
}
```

we'll need a new function/pipeline to get into the `widget`, but first lets check our suspicion that these uuid's correspond with the `Identifier`s from the `Items` above

(I tried to use `nplutil` with `-extract x json`  to pipe to `jq` but no dice; so instead... )

huh. The good news is that they _mostly_ match. The bad news is that in addition to the mystery of why my instances contains one more than my total visible widgets, (presumably) that one ***AND*** a second one (of the 9) are otherwise-indexed.

I can tell you from previous work that one of them (and probably both?) are actually from the widgets that are _actually_ in NotificationCenter (when I click on clock, below the notifications). There are two there - and it's probably those

Why are there "only" 10 if I 9 widgets on Desktop and 2 there? I'm not sure yet, but I'd guess its to do with [AirBuddy](https://v2.airbuddy.app/) having shipped their own widgets _just_ before Apple announced this support, and still using their own rendering, but wanting to keep a placeholder? (implying I'm _not_ the first person to go through (some of) this). TBD.

---

Anyway, now its time to look into one of those `instance.widget`s; There are other ways probs but lets keep it simple

```shell
instwidgetp() { nplutil instances.$1 -extract widget raw | base64 -D | plutil -p - }
```

then

```shell
instwidgetp 0
```

```output

  }
  "$version" => 100000
}

```

... from here, as above I realized (after a bit) the graph of value = UIDs to stuff in `$objects`as described above. This might be common knowledge to an apple ecosystem dev, but was new to me

doing

```shell
for n in $(seq 0 9); do instwidgetp $n | grep '\$classname'; done | sort | uniq -c
```

```output
 10       "$classname" => "CHSExtensionIdentity"
   8       "$classname" => "CHSIntentReference"
  10       "$classname" => "CHSWidget"
   7       "$classname" => "NSMutableData"
```

confirms everything has ~fairly similar structure.

then I did more variations on that to elucidate further whats going on; but for a summary:

### `widgets`.`widgets`

This appears to be a list of all avaliable widgets on your system(s)

As with `instance` the bulk of it is in a further nested plist, this time under key `encodedDescriptor` (oh hey, more camel case!)

There are also (seemingly unused) keys; being for all 553 entries I have:

- `localizedLocale` ==  `en_US@calendar=iso860` (this one probably actually depends on your system, but seems same across all)

- `version` = [empty string]
- `modDate` = `0001-01-01 00:00:00 +0000` (Happy First Easter?)



### `widgets`.`widgets[*]`.`encondedDescriptor`

Here again we find `NSKeyedArchiver` data; skipping over that format, it appears down here we are looking at

Objects of class `CHSWidgetDescriptor`.

\[It was only at this point that I looked into not doing this manually and grabbed [`nskeyedarchiver_converter`](https://crates.io/crates/nskeyedarchiver_converter); soooo ... you get this here, I might come back to it\]

(See above collapsed discussions for definition of `nplutil` if you care)

```shell
wdplutilp() { nplutil widgets.$1 -extract encodedDescriptor raw | base64 -D  }
```

```shell
wdplutilp 0 > ~/Downloads/widget0descriptor.bin
nskeyedarchiver_converter ~/Downloads/widget0descriptor.bin ~/Downloads/widget0descriptor.plist
plutil -p ~/Downloads/widget0descriptor.plist
```

```output
